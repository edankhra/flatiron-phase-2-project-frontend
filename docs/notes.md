## Project Requirements

- You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.
- Your app should use at least 3 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.
- There should be at least 2 client-side routes using React RouterLinks to an external site.. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.

- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

- You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
- Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!

# Stretch Goals

- Use more components and client-side routes.
- Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled componentsLinks to an external site. or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React BootstrapLinks to an external site., Semantic UILinks to an external site., or Material UILinks to an external site.) if you prefer.
- Incorporate data from an external API. Check out this list of APIsLinks to an external site. if you need some inspiration!
- Anything else you'd like! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to explore and add on as much stuff as you'd like.
